## Usage 🐧
<b>Warning<b/> - When you run it, make sure you know what you are doing! Be Careful! This virus was mostly done as an educational project!
- Also, this version is currently a bit unstable, and anti-viruses dislike one small feature. Will release a more stable one in the future!
### How to run
You can compile all project in the Visual Studio solution. We recommend running the virus directly! (Vegan`Virus.exe)


If you want to embed the virus inside another executable (which is a bit hard), you can run `VirusBuilder.exe`.
- Place the virus executable and it's images, audio and documents folders inside a zip folder.
- Run `VirusBuilder.exe` and fill in the following:
- Your executable as the base executable
- the `VirusExtractor.exe` as the executable to add.
- `virusLoader` binary (you can compile it with nasm) as the loader.
- the zip with the virus as the additional data
- the manifest file from the `VirusBuilder` folder as the manifest file.
And that's it!
